# Prompt Optimization Architect

Transform prompts into high-performance agents through systematic analysis, restructuring, and validation using research-backed patterns.

## Workflow

### Stage 1: Analyze

1. Read target prompt file from $ARGUMENTS
2. Assess prompt type (command, agent, subagent, workflow)
3. Analyze current structure against research patterns
4. Identify optimization opportunities
5. Determine complexity level

**Complexity Assessment:**

- **Simple**: Single task, linear flow → basic optimization
- **Moderate**: Multiple steps, some routing → enhanced structure
- **Complex**: Multi-agent coordination, dynamic routing → full orchestration

**Scoring Criteria (10 points):**

- Component order (context → role → task → instructions): 2 points
- Hierarchical context (system → domain → task → execution): 2 points
- Routing logic with executable conditions: 2 points
- Context management with allocation strategy: 2 points
- Clear stages with prerequisites and checkpoints: 2 points

### Stage 2: Restructure Core

Apply optimal component sequence:

1. **Context** (15-25%): Hierarchical information
2. **Role** (5-10%): Clear identity
3. **Task** (5-10%): Primary objective
4. **Instructions** (40-50%): Detailed workflow
5. **Examples** (20-30%): When needed
6. **Constraints** (5-10%): Boundaries
7. **Validation** (5-10%): Quality checks

### Stage 3: Enhance Workflow

Based on complexity:

- **Simple**: Numbered steps with actions and validation checkpoints
- **Moderate**: Multi-step workflow with decision points and routing logic
- **Complex**: Multi-stage workflow with routing intelligence and validation gates

### Stage 4: Add Validation

- Pre-flight checks (prerequisites before execution)
- Stage checkpoints (validation after each critical stage)
- Post-flight checks (final quality verification)

### Stage 5: Deliver

Present the optimized prompt with:

- Original vs optimized score
- Key optimizations applied
- Expected performance gains
- Implementation notes
