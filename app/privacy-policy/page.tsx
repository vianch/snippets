				<hr />

				<h2>5. Data Minimisation and Accuracy</h2>
				<p>
					We only collect personal data that is adequate, relevant, and limited
					to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is
					processed. We also take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal
					data is accurate and kept up to date.
				</p>

				<hr />

				<h2>6. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
				<p>
					We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal data to
					outside parties for marketing purposes. We may share your personal
					data with third parties in the following circumstances:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may employ third-party
						companies and individuals to facilitate our Platform, provide
						services on our behalf (e.g., hosting, analytics), or assist us in
						analysing how our Platform is used. These third parties will have
						access to your personal data only to perform these tasks on our
						behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other
						purpose.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your personal
						data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by
						public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency).
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger,
						acquisition, or asset sale, your personal data may be transferred as
						part of that transaction. We will provide notice before your
						personal data is transferred and becomes subject to a different
						Privacy Policy.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<hr />

				<h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
				<p>
					We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to
					fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of
					satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
				</p>
				<p>
					To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we
					consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the
					potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
					personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data
					and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
					applicable legal requirements.
				</p>
				<p>
					Typically, account data and associated snippets will be retained for
					as long as your account remains active. If your account becomes
					inactive for a significant period, or if you request account deletion,
					we will delete or anonymise your data, unless we are legally required
					to retain it.
				</p>

				<hr />

				<h2>8. Data Security</h2>
				<p>
					We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security
					measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost,
					used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered, or disclosed. In
					addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees,
					agents, contractors, and other third parties who have a business need
					to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions
					and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite our efforts, no method of transmission over the Internet or
					method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
					commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot
					guarantee its absolute security.
				</p>

				<hr />

				<h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
				<p>
					As our Platform is a demo, we aim to keep data processing within the
					UK/EEA where possible. However, some of our third-party service
					providers may be based outside the UK/EEA. Whenever we transfer your
					personal data out of the UK/EEA, we ensure a similar degree of
					protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following
					safeguards is implemented:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been
						deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data
						by the Information Commissioner&apos;s Office (ICO).
					</li>
					<li>
						Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific
						contracts approved by the ICO which give personal data the same
						protection it has in the UK.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<hr />

				<h2>10. Your Data Protection Rights (UK GDPR)</h2>
				<p>
					Under certain circumstances, you have the following rights under UK
					GDPR in relation to your personal data:
